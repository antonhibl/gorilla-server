# 🔥🦍🦍🦍🔥 Gorilla Server 🔥🦍🦍🦍🔥

I am finally adapting my server code to a more professional toolset using Gorilla Toolset for Go. This will allow me to include things like secure
authentication, improved site and user security, and more powerful web tools. I plan to include a full featured WebAssembly game written in Rust that
will be entirely communicated using Websockets. I also want to include more and more blogging here so plan to see updates from both my medium account 
the site blog posted on here. 

Feel free to use this code yourself but if it is going to be monetized at least put my name somewhere for credit, thanks!
