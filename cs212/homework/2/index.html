	<h1>The Beale Papers</h1> 
	<p>
  The Beale ciphers (or Beale Papers) are a set of three ciphertexts, 
  one of which allegedly states the location of a buried treasure of 
  gold, silver and jewels estimated to be worth over US$43 million as 
  of January 2018. Comprising three ciphertexts, the first (unsolved) 
  text describes the location, the second (solved) ciphertext the 
  content of the treasure, and the third (unsolved) lists the names of 
  the treasure's owners and their next of kin.
	</p>
	<p>
  The story of the three ciphertexts originates from an 1885 pamphlet 
  detailing treasure being buried by a man named Thomas J. Beale in a 
  secret location in Bedford County, Virginia, in about 1820. Beale 
  entrusted a box containing the encrypted messages to a local innkeeper 
  named Robert Morriss and then disappeared, never to be seen again. 
  According to the story, the innkeeper opened the box 23 years later, 
  and then decades after that gave the three encrypted ciphertexts to a 
  friend before he died. The friend then spent the next twenty years of 
  his life trying to decode the messages, and was able to solve only one 
  of them, which gave details of the treasure buried and the general 
  location of the treasure. The unnamed friend then published all three 
  ciphertexts in a pamphlet which was advertised for sale in the 1880s.
    </p>
	<p>
  Since the publication of the pamphlet, a number of attempts have been
  made to decode the two remaining ciphertexts and to locate the 
  treasure, but all efforts have resulted in failure.

	<h2>The Plaintext of Paper 2</h2> 
	<p>
	<b>The plaintext of paper two reads:</b> <em>I have deposited in the 
	county of Bedford, about four miles from Buford's, in an excavation 
	or vault, six feet below the surface of the ground, the following 
	articles, belonging jointly to the parties whose names are given in 
	number three, herewith:

    The first deposit consisted of ten hundred and fourteen pounds of gold, 
	and thirty-eight hundred and twelve pounds of silver, deposited Nov. 
	eighteen nineteen. The second was made Dec. eighteen twenty-one, and 
	consisted of nineteen hundred and seven pounds of gold, and twelve 
	hundred and eighty-eight of silver; also jewels, obtained in St. Louis 
	in exchange to save transportation, and valued at thirteen thousand 
	dollars.

    The above is securely packed in iron pots, with iron covers. The vault 
	is roughly lined with stone, and the vessels rest on solid stone, and 
	are covered with others. Paper number one describes the exact locality 
	of the vault, so that no difficulty will be had in finding it.</em>
	</p>
	<h2>Decipherment and Estimated Value</h2> 
	<p>
	The second cipher can be decrypted fairly easily using a modified copy 
	of the United States Declaration of Independence, but some editing is 
	necessary. To decrypt it, one finds the word corresponding to the number 
	(e.g., the first number is 115, and the 115th word in the Declaration of 
	Independence is "instituted"), and takes the first letter of that word 
	(in the case of the example, "I").

	Beale used a version of United States Declaration of Independence 
	slightly different from the original, and made mistakes in numbering it. 
	To extract the hidden message, the following five modifications must be 
	applied to the original text:
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>after word 154 ("institute") and before word 157 ("laying") one 
		  word must be added. The pamphlet handles this by inserting "a" 
		  before "new government".</li>
	  <li>after word 240 ("invariably") and before word 246 ("design") 
		  one word must be removed. The pamphlet's numbering has eleven 
		  words between the labels for 240 and 250.</li>
	  <li>after word 466 ("houses") and before word 495 ("be") ten words 
		  must be removed. The pamphlet has two labels for 480.</li>
	  <li>after word 630 ("eat") and before word 654 ("to") one word must 
		  be removed. The pamphlet's numbering has eleven words between 
		  the labels for 630 and 640.</li>
	  <li>after word 677 ("foreign") and before word 819 ("valuable") one 
		  word must be removed. The pamphlet's numbering has eleven words 
		  between the labels for 670 and 680.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	Furthermore, many versions of the Declaration of Independence have been 
	printed, with various adjustments to paragraphing, word inclusion, word 
	changing, spelling, capitalization, and punctuation.

	The lack of clear images of the original ciphers, combined with the large 
	quantity of numerals, has led to numerals being misprinted or omitted in 
	many sources.
	</p>
	<b>The Value</b>
	<hr>
	<em>The treasure's total weight is about 3 tons as described in inventory 
		of the second cryptogram. This includes approximately 35,052 troy oz 
		gold, 61,200 troy oz silver (worth about US$42 m and US$1 m, 
		respectively, in January 2017) and jewels worth around US$220,000 in 
		2017.</em>

	<h1>Addendum</h1>
	<p>
	I seperated the main paper into respective pieces based on the original
	paper's abstract, the 3 ciphertexts, the decipherment description, and 
	the estimated value. I chose this structure as it would clearly lay out
	the material in an approachable way for the reader as well as relevant data
	and information is kept in its' respective section. I used bold and
	emphasized text in places where original transcriptions were found as well
	as an unordered list to list off the relevant changes needed to make the
	second paper's decipherment. Overall It was mainly packed paragraphs beneath
	h2 headers all further wrapped by the main h1 header which held the paper's
	data for the Beale Ciphers. All of this was packaged within an article to 
	clarify it is a self reliant piece of text apart from this addendum which 
	is in it's own article tag. I mainly referenced a JSTOR article which is 
	listed below however the NSA and CIA have multiple pieces of photographic 
	evidence which can be read and drawn from to garner a whole picture of the 
	story of the legendary cryptographic Beale Papers. Due to this fact of readily
	available public resources it was actually quite easy to research and compile
	the contents of this paper.
