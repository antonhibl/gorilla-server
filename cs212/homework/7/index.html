                <code>
                    ROT13(plaintext) = ciphertext, rot13(ciphertext) = plaintext

				<h4>Addendum</h4> 
				<p>
					I used an explicit css grid layout using a template with various names for identifiers; after this I could simply use this container div to hold all of my sections that would need to be implemented for a "Holy Grail" layout. Once I filled in these sections it was a matter of assigning their identifiers with css in order to place them in my grid. After this I used dynamic styling with percentages to ensure that my page would also adapt well to smaller screens such as phones. I also utilized a media screen selector query in order to match the screen size with a respectable page sizing values I also found the navbar became cramped on mobile when using text to identify my links, therefore I changed these to be icons with much smaller text alongside in order so that they fit better especially when viewing on smaller screens, I simply wrapped the icons in an address element to ensure the linking wrapped correctly. Next I implemented my Javascript which wasnt more than a function which responds to an input button I placed in my page which would read text from one text area element and then encipher it and placing the output in a defined section below. This was easily handled by simple Javascript where I could identify an html element by it's ID and then gather or replace the value of the inner HTML by reassignments. After this I placed an image linking to an amazon product in my aside with some styling to make it look good. Finally I placed a simple description of what the javascript does down below with some styled pseudo-code to go with, another html form which lets the user email me, and lastly this addendum was added to explain my design choices.
